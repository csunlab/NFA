version 1.20 - for Python 3 and pandas 0.20.3 and later

See version 1.10 if you are running Python 2


Whatâ€™s new

- added '#!/usr/bin/env python3' on top of every code to ensure the code runs in Python 3.

- changed all 'raw_input()' to 'input()' to adapt code to run in Python 3.

- added the option to enter lower case letters as well as upper case; e.g., can enter 'y' as well as 'Y'.

- updated code with ".iloc" as opposed to ".ix" since ".ix" will be depreciated in future versions of pandas.

- remove the use of the library OS in the final line of the NFA_main.py code.
